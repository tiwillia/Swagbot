Known Issues:
-=~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~=-
- The 'bothandler' should not be seperate, it should be a model.

TODO list:
-=~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~=-
1) Add ability to add numerous ncq check rules
2) Add 'api' where someone can POST with credentials to make a bot say something.
3) Re-vamp the web backend. Its ugly as hell.

In Progress Notes:
-=~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~=-
1) NCQ check rules
   - Create a database table with the following:
     - use_default_ping_term  (Use the default ping term instead)
     - ping_term   (Term to ping in channel
     - search_type ("plate" or "product")
     - math_string  (string for plate or product)
     - bot_id
   - Bot should use these rules to cehck the ncq and ping the correct person
   - Add a view of some sort specifically to add the ncq rules (perhaps wait till 3)
