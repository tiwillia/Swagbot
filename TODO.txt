Add a way to have the bot periodically (at a configurable interval) check the ncq for a product or sbr.

Should keep a list (in memory) of cases already pinged out. Should only ping new ones it has not pinged before.

Use the JSON unified curl stuff to get JSON data back from unified

Should be able to use the timers already created for karma timeout for the interval.

Unified shiz:
=======================
<erich> tim, http://pastebin.test.redhat.com/207762 
<erich> tim curl -Lv --get --data-urlencode "sso_username=rhn-support-edrich" --data-urlencode "command=show plate Webservers" --data-urlencode "command_type=EXTERNAL"  http://unified.gsslab.rdu2.redhat.com/ajax/
<erich> tim, note you may want to change that is uses the -k flag with curl and so that it uses https://
<erich> tim, also change the sbr
